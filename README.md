# What is this?

In short: **This is a curated collection of my personal ventures into the world of knowledge.** 

Although I've never really cared for exams and tests (since they tend to shift the focus from the knowledge itself to measurments), I eventually came to the conclusion that I need something I can use to demonstrate my capabilities. This is that something; An educational portfolio of sorts that is meant to serve as an alternative (and/or supplement) to grades and other notions of measure imposed upon me by educational systems around the world.

I plan to sort the "ventures" -or projects if you prefer- by the field of study they belong in,  and make them searchable by institution, course, year and the like.



# The name
Curriculum cognitionis (CC) is Latin, and literally translated means:
> (The) course of (my) knowledge/aquirement

The choice of name is inspired by the CV (Curriculum Vitae).

**Note:** It might be that I invent some other (cooler) word for it later and hence replace CC with a fresher phrase.
