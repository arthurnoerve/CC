# What is this?

In short: **This is a curated collection of my personal ventures into the world of knowledge.** 

This educational portfolio of sorts is meant to serve as an alternative (and/or supplement) to grades and other notions of meassure 



# The name
Curriculum cognitionis (CC) is Latin, and literally translated means:
> (The) course of (my) knowledge/aquirement

The choice of name is inspired by the CV (Curriculum Vitae).

**Note:** It might be that I invent some cool word for it later and hence replace CC with a fresher phrase.
